              <h1 class="pheading">The origin  of Tic Tac Toe game </h1>
                <p>Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on 
                  roofing tiles dating from around  <em>1300 BC</em>. </p>
                <p>An early variation of <i>tic-tac-toe</i> was played in the Roman Empire, around the <em>first century BC</em>. It was called <i>terni lapilli 
                  (three pebbles at a time)</i> and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them 
                  around to empty spaces to keep playing. </p>
                <p>The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is <i>three men's morris</i> which
                  is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish,  and <i>Picaria</i>, a game of the Puebloans.</p>

              <h1 class="pheading">The strategy to playing the game</h1>
                <p>
                  The best way for <strong>"X"</strong> player is to start in middle. In each &#x2610;, the shaded red <strong style="color: red;">X</strong> denotes the optimal move, and the 
                  location of <strong>O's</strong> next move gives the next sub grid to examine.</p>
                <p>Note that only two sequences of moves by <strong>O</strong> (both starting with the centre, top-right, left-mid) lead to a draw, 
                  with the remaining sequences leading to wins from <strong>X</strong>.</p>
                <p>Optimal strategy for player <strong>O</strong>. Player <strong>O</strong> can only force a <i>win</i> or <i>draw</i> by playing in the centre first.</p>

              <h1 class="pheading">How to win or draw!</h1>

                <p>A player can play a perfect game of <i>tic-tac-toe</i> (to win or at least draw) if, each time it is their turn to play, they choose 
                  the first available move from the following list, as used in <em>Newell and Simon's</em> 1972 <i>tic-tac-toe</i> program.</p>

                <ul>Tips to follow:
                    <li class="list"><strong>Win:</strong> If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.</li>
                    <li class="list"><strong>Block:</strong> If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.</li>
                    <li class="list"><strong>Fork: </strong>Cause a scenario where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).</li>
                    <li class="list">Blocking an opponent's <strong>fork:</strong> If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player should block it. </li>
                    <li class="list"><strong>Centre: </strong>A player marks the centre. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a corner move gives the 
                      second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The first player, who shall be designated <strong>"X"</strong>, has three possible strategically distinct positions to mark during the first turn. </p>
