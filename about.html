          <h2 class="pheading">The origin of Tic Tac Toe game</h2>
          <div class="flexbox">
            <p>
              Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to
              ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing
              tiles dating from around <em>1300 BC</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              An early variation of <i>tic-tac-toe</i> was played in the Roman
              Empire, around the <em>first century BC</em>. It was called
              <i>terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time)</i> and instead of
              having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus,
              they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.
            </p>

            <p>
              The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome.
              Another closely related ancient game is
              <i>three men's morris</i> which is also played on a simple grid
              and requires three pieces in a row to finish, and <i>Picaria</i>,
              a game of the Puebloans.

          <h2 class="pheading">The strategy to playing the game</h2>
          <div class="flexbox">
            <p>
              The best way for <strong>"X"</strong> player is to start in
              middle. In each &#x2610;, the shaded red
              <strong style="color: red">X</strong> denotes the optimal move,
              and the location of <strong>O's</strong> next move gives the next
              sub grid to examine.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that only two sequences of moves by <strong>O</strong> (both
              starting with the centre, top-right, left-mid) lead to a draw,
              with the remaining sequences leading to wins from
              <strong>X</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Optimal strategy for player <strong>O</strong>. Player
              <strong>O</strong> can only force a <i>win</i> or <i>draw</i> by
              playing in the centre first.

          <div class="flexboxTwo">
            <p>
              A player can play a perfect game of <i>tic-tac-toe</i> (to win or
              at least draw) if, each time it is their turn to play, they choose
              the first available move from the following list, as used in
              <em>Newell and Simon's</em> 1972 <i>tic-tac-toe</i>program.
            </p>

          <h2 class="pheading">Tips to follow:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="list">
              <strong>Win:</strong> If the player has two in a row, they can
              place a third to get three in a row.
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              <strong>Block:</strong> If the opponent has two in a row, the
              player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              <strong>Fork: </strong>Cause a scenario where the player has two
              ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              Blocking an opponent's <strong>fork:</strong> If there is only one
              possible fork for the opponent, the player should block it.
            </li>

            <li class="list">
              <strong>Centre: </strong>A player marks the centre. (If it is the
              first move of the game, playing a corner move gives the second
              player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be
              the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect
              players.)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The first player, who shall be designated <strong>"X"</strong>, has
            three possible strategically distinct positions to mark during the
            first turn.
